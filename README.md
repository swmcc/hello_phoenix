# My First Phoenix App 

**my·first·phoenix*app*  */ˈphoenixˌapp/*

## Description

I wanted to play with the [Phoenix][(http://www.phoenixframework.org/)
Framework.  This is my first attempt. So I followed the links at [up and
running](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/up-and-running). Then wanted to
deploy it to [heroku](http://www.heroku.com) using this
[article](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku).

I am currently learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and loving it. Being
from a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) background I wanted to keep away from
Phoenix for as long as possible. One of the biggest errors any developer in
learning a new language is to delve straight into a framework... However I am
weak - and I think two months is enough time so lets see what happens. 

This is just my first attempt at getting 'something' up and running so I can't 
really give any useful insights just yet... No doubt I'll do that in a repo soon.
